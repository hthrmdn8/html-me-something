          <figcaption>Basil</figcaption>
            <p>Basil is a culinary herb of the family <em>Lamiaceae</em>. 
                Basil is native to tropical regions from central Africa to Southeast Asia. 
                It is a tender plant, and is used in cuisines worldwide. 
                Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat like anise, 
                with a strong, pungent, often sweet smell.</p>

              <p>Scientifically known as <strong>Salvia officinalis</strong>, sage is closely related to rosemary.
                    In fact, many of the health benefits from sage
                  are derived from the rosmarinic acid, the organic compound found in rosemary that 
                  makes it powerful. Despite many similarities, sage is distinct in that it is 
                  actually an evergreen shrub with woody stems and blue-purple flowers found 
                  in the Mediterranean region.</p>

              <p>Parsley is a species of flowering plant in the family <em>Apiaceae</em> 
                  that is native to the central Mediterranean region, but has naturalized 
                  elsewhere in Europe, and is widely cultivated as an herb, a spice, and a vegetable.</p>

              <figcaption>Oregano</figcaption>
              <p><strong>Organum</strong>, or Oregano comes from the mint family <em>Liliaceae</em>. 
                  Oregano is originally from the warmer climates, such as the Mediterranean region.  
                  Oregano originated and originally first used by the Greeks. 
                  The Goddess Aphrodite was believed to have created this herb.  
                  It was to be a symbol of joy growing in her garden. The word oregano 
                  derives from the Greek phrase Eros, meaning mountain, and ganos, meaning joy.  
                  Hence, joy of the mountains.</p>

              <p>Mint is a fast-growing, aromatic herb plant in the <em>Mentha</em> genus. 
                  There are literally hundreds of mint plant varieties and far too many to 
                  name here. However, a number of these mint types are commonly grown in the garden</p>
