                    <h2>Basil</h2>
                    <p>Basil, also called great basil, is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae. 
                        Basil is native to tropical regions from central Africa to Southeast Asia. 
                        It is a tender plant, and is used in cuisines worldwide. 
                        Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat like anise, 
                        with a strong, pungent, often sweet smell.</p>

                    <h2>Sage</h2>
                    <p>Scientifically known as Salvia officinalis, sage is closely related to rosemary; 
                        they are often considered “sister herbs.” In fact, many of sage’s health benefits 
                        are derived from the rosmarinic acid, the organic compound found in rosemary that 
                        makes it powerful. Despite many similarities, sage is distinct in that it is 
                        actually an evergreen shrub with woody stems and blue-purple flowers found 
                        in the Mediterranean region.</p>

                    <h2>Parsley</h2>
                    <p>Parsley or garden parsley is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae 
                        that is native to the central Mediterranean region, but has naturalized 
                        elsewhere in Europe, and is widely cultivated as an herb, a spice, and a vegetable.</p>

                    <h2>Oregano</h2>
                    <p>Organum, or Oregano comes from the mint family, (Liliaceae). 
                        Oregano is originally from the warmer climates, such as the Mediterranean region.  
                        Oregano originated and originally first used by the Greeks. 
                        The Goddess Aphrodite was believed to have created this herb.  
                        It was to be a symbol of joy growing in her garden. The word oregano 
                        derives from the Greek phrase Eros, meaning mountain, and ganos, meaning joy.  
                        Hence, joy of the mountains.</p>

                        There are literally hundreds of mint plant varieties and far too many to 
                        name here. However, a number of these mint types are commonly grown in the garden</p>
